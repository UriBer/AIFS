Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Core Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled training data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with environment

Popular Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-Means Clustering

Applications:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial forecasting

Machine learning has revolutionized many industries and continues to advance rapidly with new techniques and applications.
